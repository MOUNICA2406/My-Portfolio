        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Mounica, an aspiring frontend developer. My love for designing coupled with my problem-solving ability allows me to integrate technology into art to create engaging web solutions that will be remembered forever. I am always searching for motivation in the world outside as an explorer among others on the internet. The hustle of urban streets and calmness of nature are some of the experiences that spur my creativity and contribute towards my development strategies in web. We can start together in this journey where code meets creative energy and technology changes life.</p>
